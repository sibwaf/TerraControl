TerraControl
============
Remake of Monsterra.
The main goal is to capture more cells than your enemy by changing color of your field. Cells will merge with your field if colors match.

2. Level size in cells, used only by server to generate level
3. Address to connect (client only), server port (both client and server)

5. Fast generation uses loop instead of level updates. Sometimes may be a lot slower than standard (server only)
6. Running client and server
